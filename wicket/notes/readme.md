## Clean, Beautiful Simple Design - Code Design
    - Easier to understand by your fellow developers and by you after a few weeks.
    - Easier to maintain.


## 1. Separation of Html code from Java code
    - You don't pollute Html code with Java code thus the designer works with valid .html files can even open it in the browser and work on it with his tools.
    - No "framework specific" tags that you must learn and cannot use anywhere else like o, you use just plain html ones.

## Component based framework
    - Validators contain the validation logic that in this cases includes

## Good OOP concepts that appeal to Java developers
    - Inheritance
    -
    - You work to extend and assemble components

## Model separated from Component.
    - Use different Models for same component
    -

##  You are in control of what is being generated.
    - There is no code generated "by magic". Wicket only has a small set with which you replace one component with another.
    - This can be viewed as both good or bad. Many Java web developers think that JS is not their job and they prefer .
    Problem is that , and you end up tweaking
    With today's web application where web page render speed is key you cannot work with auto-generated big JS files.


    With wicket you only get the minimum
